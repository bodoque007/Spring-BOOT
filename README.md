Some Spring Boot basic, small practice projects. The most complete ones are crudMVCDemo and RESTAPI.
As for now, a project implementing some Spring security features, another implementing a basic REST API and another implementing a basic CRUD app with Thymeleaf on the frontend.
Each folder is a project with its own README file, explaining more carefully the dependencies, technologies used and usage.

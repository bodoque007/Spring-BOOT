# Spring Boot Projects

The two following are the main and most complete projects:

- **crudMVCDemo:** Comprehensive CRUD application with MVC architecture.
- **RESTAPI:** Another significant project showcasing the implementation of a basic REST API with its corresponding CRUD HTTP methods.

Additionally, there are other small practice projects:

- *securityDemo:* A project implementing some basic Spring Security features.
- *validationDemo:* A project implementing basic validation using Jakarta.

Each project has its own dedicated folder with a README file, providing detailed information about dependencies, technologies used, and how to use the project.

# Spring Boot Projects

The two following are the main and most complete projects, each with their own README:

- **RESTAPI:** Most significant project, showcasing the implementation of a basic REST API with its corresponding CRUD HTTP methods. It too implements CSV data loading, testing with Mockito and JUnit.
- **crudMVCDemo:** Comprehensive CRUD application with MVC architecture.

Additionally, there are other small practice projects, each with their own README too:

- *securityDemo:* A project implementing some basic Spring Security features.
- *validationDemo:* A basic form project implementing basic validation using Jakarta.
